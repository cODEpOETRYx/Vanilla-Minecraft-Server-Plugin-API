# Vanilla Minecraft Server PluginAPI
A socket PHP program which can be used to run vanilla Minecraft servers with plugins. It does not modificate the jar file, only runs as a third party program. It is compatible with modded server too, so it can be also used for creating plugins in PHP.

Plugin API documentation on our wiki page. 

Remember, that as it's vanilla, it is not as powerful as modificated jar files, such as Bukkit, Spigot or Forge. It can't be used to modify packets. It only runs as a third-party program. It can be used however to add custom commands and some other minor features, and to program your modules in an actual programming language (PHP) rather than command blocks, which cause lag and have no advanced operators.

Features:
 - Add custom commands.
 - Filter chat.
 - Execute server commands as the console.
 - Receive information such as online players.
